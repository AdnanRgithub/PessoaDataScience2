<p>What does the title even mean?</p>
<p>Say you encountered this in a statistics text: <span class="math display">\[ x \sim N(0, 1) \]</span> which just says that the random variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is normally distributed with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> mean and variance <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. If you write that in your program, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will automatically be distributed that way and draws from that distribution will be drawn when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is needed <strong>elsewhere</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a more complex model: <span class="math display">\[ z_{lk} = p_{l} + \epsilon_{l, k}, k = 1, 2, \cdots, n \]</span> This is ugly, but <span class="math inline">\({lk}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({l}\)</span> are just subscripts, that is, indeces. What does this mean? The varible <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is estimated as an <strong>additive</strong> contribution of a population effect of the variable that you are interested in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (for example, the experimental condition that you manipulated <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>; “ell”) and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{lk}\)</span> is the deviation (or effect) of subject <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> on condition <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>.</p>
<p>What does this mean? If you know what the Stroop effect is: <span class="math inline">\(p_l\)</span> could be the contribution (effect) of an incongruent condition. And <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{l,k}\)</span> the contribution (effect) of subject <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, that is, sort of the average response time across all conditions for that person (if I’m fast in general, or slow in general). So what the experimental condition (incongruent trials) does is a <strong>deviation</strong> from my average reaction time based on the condition.</p>
<p>By including both a <strong>fixed effect p</strong> (the conditions of your experiment; they are fixed, right?) and the <strong>random effect</strong> (the one that you draw randomly), that is, participants, you have a <strong>mixed-effcts model</strong> And you’re done! Or not far from it actually (so close that it’s scary).</p>
<p>If you don’t know what the Stroop effect is, it doesn’t matter (but look it up). The model is general and that’s what math is for, right?</p>
<p>Well, this was a little longer than I thought.</p>
